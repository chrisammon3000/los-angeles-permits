# Los Angeles Construction Permits Exploratory Data Analysis
This project looks at a dataset provided by the City of Los Angeles containing data on building permits. Data can be accessed here: [Building and Safety Permit Information](https://data.lacity.org/A-Prosperous-City/Building-and-Safety-Permit-Information/yv23-pmwf).

#### -- Project Status: [Active]

## Project Intro
The purpose of this project is find useful metrics for evaluating the construction industry, housing market and local economy. With the data it is possible to get a high level overview of construction activity and development in the city. It becomes possible to find answers to questions such as which areas have the most development occurring, predict where new development may occur, and analyze changes in the types of permits being issued.

### Methods Used
